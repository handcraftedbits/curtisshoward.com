I am a software engineer living in [Cary, NC](https://www.townofcary.org).  This site is intended to showcase my
software projects and keep track of various bits of information that I've learned over the years.

The content on this site is wholly my own and is not in any way associated with my employer, [SAS
Institute](https://www.sas.com).
